### Communication
```
•	Through my work and college experiences I understand how important open and clear communication can be to the success of a project. 
•	My work experiences have taught me how to communicate verbally with people who don’t have in-depth knowledge of a process, so clear explanation and reasoning are key to getting a point across. 
•	My college education has been largely online so written communication with classmates and teachers has been a large part of my academic success. I will leverage all my skills and master new ones that I need to have a successful career.
